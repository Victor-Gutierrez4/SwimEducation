      <h2>Preventing Drowning</h2>
      <p>Drowning can happen quickly and silently, especially with young children. Always supervise swimmers, even in shallow water. Use life jackets if you have very minimal swimming experience. Enroll kids in swimming lessons early to build water confidence and safety awareness.</p>

      <h2>Recognizing Hazards</h2>
      <p>Even in an indoor pool, hazards can be present. Always be aware of the pool’s depth markings and warning signs around the pool area. Check for posted pool rules that highlight specific safety guidelines for swimmers, such as no diving in shallow areas, no running, and no horseplay. Pay attention to the presence of lifeguards and their stations, which are usually well-marked, and understand their role in maintaining safety.</p>
      <p>Indoor pools might also have other safety considerations like slippery floors, faulty or broken equipment, and poor visibility in certain areas. It’s important to familiarize yourself with emergency exits and safety equipment like life rings, first-aid kits, and rescue poles that are strategically placed around the pool. Additionally, if the pool is heated, be mindful of the temperature as it can sometimes cause dizziness or overheating. Proper hydration is key when swimming in warmer indoor pools.</p>

      <h2>Basic Rescue Techniques</h2>
      <p>Never jump in to save someone without a plan—reach or throw, don’t go. Use pool noodles, life rings, or sticks to help someone in trouble. Learn CPR and basic first aid to respond quickly in emergencies. These skills are crucial and can prevent tragedy.</p>

      <h2>Teaching Kids Water Safety</h2>
      <p>Teach children to ask permission before going near water and always swim with a buddy. Use water games to reinforce safety lessons in a fun way. Parents should stay within arm’s reach of young swimmers. Safety habits formed early last a lifetime.</p>
