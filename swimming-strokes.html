    </header>

    <!-- Freestyle Section -->
    <section id="freestyle">
        <h2>Freestyle</h2>
        <p>Freestyle, also known as front crawl, is the fastest and most efficient stroke. It's commonly used in races like the 100m and 200m freestyle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Body Position: Horizontal, streamlined position with face in the water.</li>
            <li>Arm Movement: Alternating arm strokes, one arm pulling while the other recovers above water.</li>
            <li>Leg Movement: Flutter kick, legs alternate in an up-and-down motion.</li>
            <li>Breathing: Turn your head to the side to inhale, exhale through your nose underwater.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Backstroke Section -->
    <section id="backstroke">
        <h2>Backstroke</h2>
        <p>Backstroke is the only stroke swum on the back. It is a relaxing, yet effective stroke for building endurance and strength.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Body Position: Floating on your back, keeping your body straight and flat.</li>
            <li>Arm Movement: Alternating arm strokes, palms facing outward during the pull phase.</li>
            <li>Leg Movement: Flutter kick, similar to freestyle but with your face above the water.</li>
            <li>Breathing: Natural breathing while floating on your back.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Breaststroke Section -->
    <section id="breaststroke">
        <h2>Breaststroke</h2>
        <p>The breaststroke is a slower stroke but it is highly efficient and easy on the body. It’s great for beginners and long-distance swimmers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Body Position: Horizontal with the head above water for breathing.</li>
            <li>Arm Movement: Symmetrical arm strokes, pulling with both arms at the same time in a half-circle motion.</li>
            <li>Leg Movement: Frog kick, legs perform a circular motion, bringing knees towards the chest before pushing outward.</li>
            <li>Breathing: Breathe during the arm recovery phase, with the head lifted above water.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Butterfly Section -->
    <section id="butterfly">
        <h2>Butterfly</h2>
        <p>The butterfly stroke is one of the most challenging yet rewarding strokes, known for its power and speed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Body Position: Undulating movement with the body moving like a wave.</li>
            <li>Arm Movement: Both arms move simultaneously in a circular motion above and below the water.</li>
            <li>Leg Movement: Dolphin kick, where both legs move together in a fluid up-and-down motion.</li>
            <li>Breathing: Head comes out of the water during the arm recovery phase to inhale, exhale underwater.</li>
        </ul>
